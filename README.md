# YouTube Video Virality Predictor

A machine learning project developed for the Google AI Studio Challenge, aiming to predict the trending potential of YouTube videos.

## Project Overview

**Business Context:** YouTube's recommendation algorithm is central to video discovery and creator success. This project aligns with Google's mission to "organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful" by providing data-driven insights into video virality. By understanding the key factors that contribute to a video's trending potential, we can support:
*   **YouTube's Goals:** Improving the accuracy and fairness of the recommendation algorithm to surface high-quality, engaging content.
*   **Creators' Strategy:** Empowering creators with actionable insights to optimize their content and reach a wider audience.

**Objective:** To build, train, and validate a machine learning model that can successfully predict a YouTube video's likelihood of becoming trending based on its metadata and early engagement metrics.
